## ðŸš— Smart Parking Lot Management System (C++)
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project simulates a Smart Parking Lot Management System using C++.
It allows cars to enter (park) and exit (remove) while keeping track of parked vehicles using a linked list.
It also demonstrates dynamic memory allocation, overflow/underflow handling, and menu-driven operations.

## âš¡ Features

âœ… Dynamic memory allocation using a linked list

âœ… Entry tracking â€“ assigns a slot number when a car is parked

âœ… Exit tracking â€“ removes a car and frees its slot

âœ… Overflow handling â€“ prevents parking when lot is full

âœ… Underflow handling â€“ prevents removing when lot is empty

âœ… Display function â€“ shows all currently parked cars
